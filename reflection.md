# What we learned:
We learned about using "while True" loops.

We learned some basics about using Python.

We learned how to use Ultrasonic and the Touch sensors.

We learned how to make both motors on a robot drive at the same time.

We leared that we need to run a program on main.py.

We learned how to make a repository on Github.

# What worked well:

The shape of the robot and the motors, and two of the sensors.

# What we would do differently:

Plan our robot better because we just winged it.

Spend more time on what we need to do rather than what we wanted.

Figure out what we know how to do vs. what we don't know how to do.
